This desk contains two agents: `%zulu` and `%zulu-follower`.

# zulu

`%zulu` maintains a stack that can be manipulated using pokes:

```
:zulu &zulu-action [%push ~zod 123.456]
```

This pushes the value `123.456` onto ~zod's stack. If we are not ~zod, we will forward the poke to ~zod.

The target ship will send a `%zulu-update` fact on path `/values`.

```
:zulu &zulu-action [%pop ~zod]
```

This pops the top of ~zod's stack. As above, if we are not ~zod, we will forward the poke to ~zod.

The target ship will send a `%zulu-update` fact on path `/values`.

# zulu-follower

`%zulu-follower` subscribes to `%zulu` and prints stack updates to the dojo. Subscriptions can be manipulated using pokes:

```
:zulu-follower &noun [%sub ~nec]
```

This subscribes to ~nec's stack.

```
:zulu-follower &noun [%unsub ~nec]
```

This unsubscribes from ~nec's stack.
